### Hey there, this is David ðŸ‘‹

I have been in the crypto space since early 2018 as an investor and a trader.

In 2021 I took my interest for crypto to a new level and became a blockchain developer.

I'm currently finishing the latest projects I have been working on, while I start applying to job in the blockchain development industry.
